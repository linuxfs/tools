This is reference for Client2/Server2 (and Client_ctl2)

1. To build tools, do "make".
2. Run server2 on each reference machine.
3. Execute client2 for indivisual use.
   For regular testing, Use client_ctl2 for your convenience.

	# ./client2 -[sr] -H <IPaddr> [-S <packet size>] [-T <time interval>]
	or
	# ./client_ctl2 ./client2 packet_size time_interval IPaddr [IPaddr2]

   (ex.) 
	# ./client_ctl2 ./client2 32768 60 10.10.0.100 10.10.0.101

That's  all.
